### Will Premium perks apply to me only or to all members in my server.

If you have enabled Premium perks for your server via the [billing management page](https://rythm.fm/app/billing), **all members** in your server will have access to Premium perks!

### How good is the audio quality that Premium provide?

Rythm Premium audio bitrate is twice as much as normal Rythm's audio bitrate.

Do note that some songs on Youtube (or other platforms) have a lower bitrate than the maximum bitrate Rythm can play, therefore they may have lower audio quality than others.

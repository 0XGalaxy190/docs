title: Rythm's Settings and How They Work
---

## Prefix
The prefix is what you use in order to tell Rythm what to do.
If you ever forget the prefix for your server, you can always mention Rythm to get the prefix.<br/>

### Changing the Prefix
To change the prefix to anything you like, use the following command:<br/>
`!settings prefix newprefix`

If you are unable to use the current prefix, you can also use the mention as the prefix:<br/>
`@Rythm#3722 settings prefix newprefix`

**Example**: If you wanted to change the prefix to be `$` so it's `$play`, use `!settings prefix $`<br/>

## Blacklist
**Note**: This only applies to text channels. In order to blacklist voice channels, you must use Discord's permission system, explained [here](/faq#blacklisting-voice-channels).

To disallow Rythm from being used within certain text channels, use the following command:<br/>
`!settings blacklist #channel`

You can also provide multiple channels for quicker blacklisting.

**Example**: If you wanted to blacklist channels named `#chat`, `#gaming` and `#international`, use `!settings blacklist #chat #gaming #international`<br/>

## How do I add Rythm to my server?

Okay, so you want to add Rythm to your server? That's great! You can add any release of Rythm that you want by going [here](https://rythmbot.co/releases). 

## The authorization process

### Step one

Once you've chosen the release of Rythm that you would like to invite from the link above and you are logged into the correct Discord account, you should now see a menu like this:

![Discord Authorization Screen](/img/docs/adding/discord-oauth2-1.png)

If you press on **Select a server**, a pop-up should appear that will let you select where you'd like to add Rythm. In this case, we'll add the bot to **User's Server**. [If you don't see your server in this drop-down, click here!](#help-i-cant-find-my-server-in-the-list)

### Step two

Once you've selected the server that'd you like to add Rythm to, you can press the **Continue** button on the bottom right of the menu.

You should now see something similar to this:

### Final Step

Once you press the **Authorize** button and complete the Captcha, you should be redirected [here](https://rythmbot.co/thanks). In addition, you'll also see a message like the one below in your Discord server. **Amazing!**

## Help! I can't find my server in the list!

### Are you signed into the correct account?

If you can't find your server in the drop-down section, this can be caused by various reasons. First, you should make sure that you're signed into the correct account. If you're not, then press the blue **Not you?** button.

### Do you have permissions in the server you want to add Rythm to?

If you're **100%** sure that you're signed into the correct account, then you should make sure that you have the correct permissions. In order to add a bot, you need to have a role with the `Manage Server` permission or `Administrator`. If you're the server owner, you have those regardless, of course.

### Open an incognito tab and invite Rythm from there.

If you're sure that you're signed into the correct account **and** that you have permissions on the server that you'd like to add Rythm to, then you should open an incognito tab and invite Rythm from there. You can find instructions in the table below, if you don't know how to do that.

| Browser  | Windows/Linux |    MacOS    |
|----------|:-------------:|:-----------:|
| Chrome   |  CTRL+Shift+N | CMD+Shift+N |
| Firefox  |  CTRL+Shift+P | CMD+Shift+P |
| Opera    |  CTRL+Shift+N | CMD+Shift+N |
| MS Edge  |  CTRL+Shift+P |     N/A     |
| Explorer |  CTRL+Shift+P |     N/A     |
| Safari   |      N/A      | CMD+SHIFT+N |

#### Why is this necessary?

Because Discord caches data into cookies, it retains old account information and glitches out the bot invite screen. By using an incognito/private browsing window, it forces Discord to use a fresh session which fixes the glitch and allows you to select a server from the drop-down menu.

### I've read everything above but none fixed my issue. What do I do?

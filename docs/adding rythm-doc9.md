# How do I add the bot to my server?

Okay, so you want to add Rythm to your server? That's great! You can add any release of Rythm that you want by going [here](https://rythmbot.co/releases). 

## The authorization process

Once you've chosen the release of Rythm that you would like to invite from the link above and logged into your Discord account, you should now see a menu like this:

![Discord Authorization Screen](/img/docs/add/discord-oauth2-1.png)

If you press on **Select a server**, a pop-up should appear that will let you select where you'd like to add Rythm to. In this case, we'll add the bot to **User's Server**:

Once you've selected the server that'd you like to add Rythm to, you can press on the **Continue** button on the bottom right of the menu.

You should now see something similar to this:

Once you press the **Authorize** button and complete the Captcha, you should be redirected [here](https://rythmbot.co/thanks). In addition to that, you'll see a message like the one below in your Discord server. **Amazing!**

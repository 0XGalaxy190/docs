Follow these steps if you wish to change your voice regions:

  - Disconnect the bot using the `!disconnect` command.
  - Open your voice channel settings.

  - Head to the **Overview** section.
  - Select a different voice region (*US East works best with Rythm*).

  - And you are good to go! Summon the bot again using either the `!summon` or `!play` commands.

:::caution note
- You must be the `Server Owner` or have a role with `Administrator`/`Manage Channels` permission in order to switch regions.
- It may take several changes to different voice regions to resolve audio issues.

title: Adding Rythm
---

Ready to start listening with Rythm? You can add any of the Rythm releases by following this link [here](https://rythmbot.co/releases). We currently offer three bots so feel free to add as many as you want!
## Step one

Once you've chosen the release of Rythm that you would like to invite from the link above and you are logged into the correct Discord account, you should now see a menu like this:

![Discord Authorization Screen](/img/docs/adding/discord-oauth2-1.png)

Tap or click the `Select a server` button. A pop-up should appear that will let you select where you'd like to add Rythm. In this case, we'll add the bot to `Music Lovers ‚ù§`.

![Choose the server that you'd like and continue](/img/docs/adding/discord-oauth2-2.gif)

:::note Note
If you don't see your server in this drop-down, [click here!](/invite_troubleshooting#when-adding-rythm-i-cant-see-my-server-in-the-list)
:::

## Step two

Once you've selected the server that you'd like to add Rythm to, you can press the **Continue** button on the bottom right of the menu.

You should now see something similar to this:

![Press authorize and you'll be good to go!](/img/docs/adding/discord-oauth2-3.png)

## Final Step

Once you press the **Authorize** button and complete the Captcha, you should be redirected [here](https://rythmbot.co/thanks). In addition, you'll also see a message like the one below in your Discord server. **Amazing!**

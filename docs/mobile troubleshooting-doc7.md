If you are on mobile and you find that you cannot add Rythm due to the fact that the link to add Rythm produces a gray screen, then please try first heading to https://discord.com/login, logging in and then using the invite link again.
If that does not work, we recommend using a desktop device.

In short: You may want to try refreshing the website to add Rythm or use a desktop device.

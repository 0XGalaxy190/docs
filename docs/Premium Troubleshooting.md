## I subscribed to Premium but I can't use Premium features!

### 1. Make sure your payment for Premium was successful.

### 2. Make sure you are using the correct commands.
  - You can look up Premium commands in the [Commands section](/commands)

### 3. Make sure you have enabled perks for your server.

  - Go to https://rythm.fm/app/billing âž  `Manage Server` and choose your correct server(s).

  - If you can't enable `Always Playing` or can't use Rythm 3-5, make sure you have enabled the perks (you should see `always playing` & `extra bots` in the Premium plan description). If not, click `Edit Plan` and add those extra perks.

### 4. Nothing above helped!

  - First, take a look at our [#outage](https://discord.com/channels/231471142685245440/359311833653313546) channel on our [Rythm Bot Discord server](https://rythm.fm/support) to see if there are any issues with Premium going on.

  - If nothing there, please mention your issue in our [#help-desk](https://discord.com/channels/231471142685245440/359355279004925954) channel on the Rythm Bot Discord server to receive assistance from a member of our Support Team.
